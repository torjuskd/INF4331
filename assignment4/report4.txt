Report of runtime of mandelbrot_4.py
mandelbrot_4: 1.783 sec


We earlier had these runtimes:
mandelbrot_1: 26.734 sec
mandebrot_2: 155.088 sec
mandelbrot_3: 1.601 sec

So we seem to get about the same runtime out of mandelbrot_4 and mandelbrot_3.
But after running these scripts a couple times, mandelbrot_3 seems just a little faster.


Comments:
---------
It was certainly easier to write this algorithm using swig, because I already have some experience writing C code.
It feels much more familiar when you can use C syntax when writing C code, and not some mix of python and C.
However, It might be easier to change the other that was written in cython, where you don't have to write headers,
use swig etc. With cython you also make less files, which means less caos.
